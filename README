The program is based on ocean program but I changed the memory allocation for each threads to watch memory usage pattern as time passes. 
First, there is no shared memory space. Each threads has its own memory space for calculation.
Second, depending on the thread number, the grid size is vary. 
	for example, 0 and 4th threads have default grid size.
		1 and 5th threads doubled from default grid size.
		2 and 6th threads tripled from default grid size.
		3 and 7th threads quadrupled from default grid size.

Execution)
	%> ./ocean_multi 450 10 8  //<grid_size>  <iteration>  <threads>

1. to watch how much memory uses in local computer
   intall valgrind
	 %> valgrind --tool=massif ./ocean_multi <grid_size> <iteration> <# of threads>
	 		The memory usage is analogous to the number of threads and the size of grid.
	 %> ms_print massif.out.#####   
			The memory usage will be displayed.

2. upload the file into the kernel.
	 %> qemu-system-x86_64 -hda Gentoo-AMD64-root_fs -kernel linux-4.5/arch/x86_64/boot/bzImage -append "root=/dev/sda console=ttyS0 -mem=512M numa=fake=2" -m 128M -nographic  
	 Memory = 128M => each numa nodes has 64MB.

	 On the cae machine, I couldn't find how to mount the image without sudo mode.
	 So I wrote the all the after booting the kernel using QEMU.
	 It seems like timer also not working on the QEMU.
	 
3. Run the code.
	 QEMU%> ./ocean_multi 450 10 8
		=> use 92.31MB of memory at the peak.
        MB  //memory usage as time passes. Below log is captured from cae machine not QEMU.
